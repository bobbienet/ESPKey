##Ordering information

I have had sucsess ordering both fully assembled units and only PCB's from PCBWay.

PCBWay will have issues with some pads on L1:ESPKey-B.Cu.gbr exceeding the outline of the PCB. 
These are the pads that will be soldered to the esp module itself, this is normal and part of the original design.
You may tell them to proceed.
