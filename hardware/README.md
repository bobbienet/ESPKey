# Ordering information

I have had sucsess ordering both fully assembled units and only PCB's from PCBWay.

PCBWay will have issues with some pads on L1:ESPKey-B.Cu.gbr exceeding the outline of the PCB (See below). 
These are the pads that will be soldered to the esp module itself, this is normal and part of the original design.
You may tell them to proceed.

### Pads exceeding the outline

You may choose to have the edges of the PCB plated on the pads where the ESP module will be soldered, this may be useful if you are going to
assemble units yourself, however it's not necessary when having the units assembled by PCBWay. the edge plating will allow you to solder by hand
however if you use solder paste this shouldn't be necessary
### Assembled unit without side plating

### Optional edge plating
